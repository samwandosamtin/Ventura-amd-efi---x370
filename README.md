it's amd based efi for Ventura. Opencore 0.8.7 version.

cpu: ryzen 7 1800x
mobo: x370 gaming plus
gpu: rx5700
nvme and sata ssd.

apple services not working, (ethernet not built-in),
external hard drive not working, (idk why)
idk sleep/wake working or not.
rest is working fine.
acceleration also working fine somehow. 
all sound ports working fine. Can listen via monitor but can't control volume. 

that's it, am still wondering how this efi works. Also thanks for amdosx discord channel.
